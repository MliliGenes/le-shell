# Warning:

This abomination of a project has drained my soul to the point where I'd rather chew glass than document it. Consider this my final act of defiance—enjoy the void where documentation should be.

## Unsolicited Advice:

If you value your sanity, run. Parsing is where happiness goes to die, and I am its latest victim. You've been warned.

## Update:

Ops, never mind - not only parsing I did, but the expansion, wildcard, and execution. Hopefully I won't update this again.

## Regrets (A Haiku of Bitterness):

"I did *ninety-five*, <br>
Yet here I stand, *unpaid*, *unseen*. <br>
Lesson learned? Trust *none*."

—Yours in eternal suffering,

(P.S. Never again.)
