# Minishell Parser Implementation Roadmap (15 Days)

Here's a practical roadmap for implementing your minishell parser, assuming 5 hours of work per day:

## Days 1-3: Tokenization & Lexer

**Day 1: Basic Setup (5 hours)**
- Set up project structure and Makefile
- Implement basic data structures (tokens, lexer)
- Create token classification functions
- Write simple tests for the lexer

**Day 2: Tokenization Logic (5 hours)**
- Implement `get_next_token` function
- Add support for simple tokens (words, pipes, redirections)
- Handle whitespace and basic tokenization
- Test with simple commands

**Day 3: Advanced Tokenization (5 hours)**
- Implement quote handling (single and double quotes)
- Handle special characters and escape sequences
- Add support for parentheses and logical operators
- Test with complex commands

## Days 4-6: Parser Implementation

**Day 4: Basic Parsing (5 hours)**
- Implement simple command parsing
- Create AST node creation functions
- Parse basic commands with arguments
- Test simple command parsing

**Day 5: Redirection Parsing (5 hours)**
- Add redirection handling
- Implement all redirection types (<, >, >>, <<)
- Connect redirections to commands
- Test command + redirection parsing

**Day 6: Pipe Parsing (5 hours)**
- Implement pipe operator parsing
- Create pipeline structures in the AST
- Handle command sequences with pipes
- Test multi-command pipelines

## Days 7-9: Advanced Parsing Features

**Day 7: Logical Operators (5 hours)**
- Implement && and || operators
- Handle operator precedence
- Test logical operator parsing
- Verify operator behavior

**Day 8: Parentheses & Subshells (5 hours)**
- Add support for parentheses grouping
- Implement subshell parsing
- Handle nested parentheses
- Test complex expressions with parentheses

**Day 9: Parser Integration & Testing (5 hours)**
- Connect all parsing components
- Implement full command line parsing
- Fix edge cases and bugs
- Create comprehensive parser tests

## Days 10-12: Variable Expansion & Environment

**Day 10: Environment Setup (5 hours)**
- Implement environment variable storage
- Create functions to get/set environment variables
- Add PATH handling for command lookup
- Test environment functionality

**Day 11: Variable Expansion (5 hours)**
- Implement $ variable expansion
- Add special $? exit status handling
- Process variables in double quotes
- Test variable expansion

**Day 12: Shell Initialization (5 hours)**
- Set up shell state and initialization
- Implement environment loading
- Add shell loop for command processing
- Test shell initialization and state

## Days 13-15: Integration, Testing & Polishing

**Day 13: Full Integration (5 hours)**
- Connect lexer, parser, and execution components
- Implement main shell loop
- Handle signal processing
- Test basic shell functionality

**Day 14: Testing & Debugging (5 hours)**
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Test all shell features systematically
- Fix bugs and edge cases
- Verify against bash behavior

**Day 15: Final Polishing (5 hours)**
- Handle error cases gracefully
- Add helpful error messages
- Clean up code and check for memory leaks
- Final testing against the project requirements

## Daily Progress Tracking

I recommend tracking your progress with a simple checklist for each day. Mark off completed items and note any challenges or modifications needed to the plan.

For the parser specifically (days 1-9), focus on getting the tokenization solid before moving to parsing, as a strong tokenizer makes parser implementation much easier.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the roadmap or provide more detailed implementation steps for any particular day?
